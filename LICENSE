Below is the original standard licence of xearth V.1.1, which was the basis of 
Xearth live Wallpaper for Android. However, all parts of this package, 
which are not covered by this original notice, should be released under
a open source license, if possible.

The notes about Unisys Corporation do not apply to the Android version of 
xearth, because the GIF-routines have been removed.
