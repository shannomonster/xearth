Guide to contributing to the Android version of Xearth V.1.1:
=============================================================

The App has no ads. The Android (Java) sources are written by me. 
Since I have really rewritten the code after the original concepts, 
if it was up to me I would release these ports into open source. But there
is one restriction coming from the original licence of xearth, from days where 
licences and definitions of open source software has not been settled that much. 
The original sources (C) are (c) by Kirk Lauritz Johnson in
1999 with a licence saying \u201cPermission to use, copy, modify
and freely distribute xearth for non-commercial and not-for-profit purposes is
hereby granted without fee, provided that both the above copyright notice and
this permission notice appear in all copies and in supporting
documentation.\u201d I am not sure, if the license of the new bundle could be
changed to any standardized up to date licence like GPL or such. So for now
I keep the original text, to be on the safe side. All parts of the package
which are not covered by the original license should be released with GPLv2.

The original source-package is included in the git package for reference and to
give credits to the original authors. The original copyright notice and
permission notice is kept for the new version to fulfill the original licence.

I have also included screenshots of the Xearth live Wallpaper running on some
different Android devices.

The App is currently also in the Google Play Store, and has been there since
2011. I try to maintain the version there for as long as I have time to do it.


I have stopped development on this app myself, because I think it is quite
complete. If someone wants to further contribute I suggest following
improvements:

1. Translate the included help/documentation of all settings into more languages
(and complete the german translation).

2. Add GPS permission, so that the actual position of the Smartphone can be used
as a view position.

3. Load actual and up to date cloud maps via internet from a server.

4. Include the earthquake visualization feature.
